# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-09

### Fixed
- **indexer:** follows the RPC cursor across pages. Previously any backlog over 200 events lost everything after the first page, because the cursor jumped to the RPC tip.

### Added
- Route tests for every endpoint against a throwaway SQLite database, through a new `buildApp()` that builds the API without starting the indexer. Tests: 57 (was 19).
- Issue forms (bug, feature) and a pull request template; blank issues off, security reports routed to SECURITY.md.
- `serviceLabel` on vouchers and receipts; `refundableAt` and `disputeReason` on vouchers. `isRefundable` follows the contract's claim-grace rule.
- `Voucher.disputeReason` column (nullable; `prisma db push` adds it in place).
- `npm run lint` (ESLint 9 + typescript-eslint) and a lint job in CI.

### Changed
- Points at the 2026-10-07 testnet deployment; `INDEXER_START_LEDGER` updated.
